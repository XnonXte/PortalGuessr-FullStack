            No, at least not currently, as that would require a lot of
            components to be migrated to function as a native mobile
            application.

            Is the code for PortalGuessr open-source?
          </h6>
          <span className="text-pg-light">
            Yes 100% of the code! Both the front-end and back-end of
            PortalGuessr is available on GitHub.

            What are the tech-stacks for PortalGuessr?
          </h6>
          <span className="text-pg-light">
            I use React for the front-end and Express for the back-end. As for
            UI specifically I use React-Bootstrap for ease of integration
            between React and Bootstrap, Bootstrap icons for you've guessed
            it... icons, and React-Router for seamless navigation between pages.
