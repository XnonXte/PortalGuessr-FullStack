          As of PortalGuessr v0.0.1 beta-test, I haven't added the feature to
          save statistics in a kind of user profile. In the future I would like
          to add leaderboard, place where a user can upload their own images,
          and so on...
        </span>
      </section>
    </>
  );
};

export default User;
